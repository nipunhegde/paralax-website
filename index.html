        What is Motivation?
    </H1>
    <h3>
        Motivation is an important part of human psychology. It arouses a person to act towards a desired goal. 
    </h3>

            Motivation is an important factor which encourages persons to give their best performance and help in reaching enterprise goals. A strong positive motivation will enable the increased output of employees but a negative motivation will reduce their performance. A key element in personnel management is motivation.

            According to Likert, “It is the core of management which shows that every human being gives him a sense of worth in face-to face groups which are most important to him….A supervisor should strive to treat individuals with dignity and a recognition of their personal worth.”

        <p>It is a driving force which promotes action. For example, hunger is a motivation which causes a desire to eat. Motivation is the purpose or psychological cause of an action.
            With animals, motivation is caused by basic needs: needs for food, water, warmth, safety, mating, protecting the young, defending territory, needs to escape pain and threats... The drive to do these things is instinctive, inborn, and triggered by circumstance.
        
            With humans, whose mental life is so much more complex, motivation is more complicated. Obviously, humans feel the need for food and water, avoid pain and so on. But they are also capable of having long-term plans which are more difficult to understand.

<h2> TYPES OF MOTIVATIONS</h2>

<div class="two-col">
    <p>
        POSITIVE MOTIVATION or incentive motivation is based on reward. 
        The workers are offered incentives for achieving the desired goals.
         The incentives may be in the shape of more pay, promotion, recognition of work, etc. 
         The employees are offered the incentives and try to improve their performance willingly.
         According to Peter Drucker, the real and positive motivators are responsible for placement,
          high standard of performance, information adequate for self- control and the participation
           of the worker as a responsible citizen in the plant community. 
    </p>
</div>
<div class="two-col">
    <p>
        NEGATIVE MOTIVATION or fear motivation is based on force or fear. 
        Fear causes employees to act in a certain way.
         In case, they do not act accordingly then they may be punished with demotions or lay-offs.
          The fear acts as a push mechanism.
           The employees do not willingly co-operate, rather they want to avoid the punishment.

Though employees work up-to a level where punishment is avoided but this type of motivation causes anger and frustration.
